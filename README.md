# clipboard

Mobile site is complete to my satisfaction. I have started the desktop version using a separate CSS file, no issues thus far though I could use some guidance
on how to take font sizes out of figma and convert them to CSS, ditto for spacings. Currently I am eyeballing everything and a long way from pixel perfect.

At present, anything from "Access Clipboard Anywhere" and beyond is unstyled. NB to create desktop.css I cut and pasted everything out of mobile.css to give me a starting point, 
therefore all the stylings after "Access Clipboard Anywhere" are remnants of the mobile site and should not be considered completed.

Also I found a cool gizmo to convert hex colour values into CSS filter properties, which I used to apply colour to the hover states of the Facebook, Twitter and Instagram 
links at the end of the page.
