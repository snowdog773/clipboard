# clipboard

Mobile site is complete to my satisfaction. I have started the desktop version using a separate CSS file, no issues thus far though I could use some guidance
on how to take font sizes out of figma and convert them to CSS, ditto for spacings. Currently I am eyeballing everything and a long way from pixel perfect.

At present, anything from "Access Clipboard Anywhere" and beyond is unstyled. NB to create desktop.css I cut and pasted everything out of mobile.css to give me a starting point, 
therefore all the stylings after "Access Clipboard Anywhere" are remnants of the mobile site and should not be considered completed.

Also I found a cool gizmo to convert hex colour values into CSS filter properties, which I used to apply colour to the hover states of the Facebook, Twitter and Instagram 
links at the end of the page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Site has been pretty much rebuilt from the ground up on the latest push. Mobile site has been carefully redesigned to match the design plan as closely as possible. Desktop site has been started but there is still work to do. There is also a point on resizing (around 700px width) where the cta buttons go a bit weird so possibly needs a "tablet" CSS stage to fix that.
